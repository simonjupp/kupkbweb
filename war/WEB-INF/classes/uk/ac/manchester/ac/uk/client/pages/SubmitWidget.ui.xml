      <h4>Want to submit your data to the KUPKB?</h4>
      <p> Then we are more than happy to assist you in doing so!! We have developed
      a simple spreadsheet template for users to submit data to the KUPKB. We aim to capture
      a minimal amount of information about the experiment and the observations
      made. Where possible we use a controlled vocabulary with terms from the KUP ontology
          that enables advanced querying capabilities in the iKUP browser.</p>

          <p>
              The template is distributed as an Microsft Excel spreadsheet and can be edited
              in either MS Excel or the open source tool OpenOffice. You can download a copy of the
              template from <a href="etc/kupkb_experiment_template_v3.xls" _target="blank">here</a>. There are some instructions in the spreadsheet
              but you can also view an example from one of the KUPKB exepriements <a href="etc/GSE12792.xls" _target="blank">here</a>. If you have any questions or
              would like assistanc in submitting your data please contact us via e-mail at support [at] kupkb.org.
